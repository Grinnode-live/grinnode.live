You can then share it for everyone, hopefully the screen-sharing will be working.

- Favorit crypto currency and why ? 
- Interesting development in the crypto space (e.g. El Hodlador - Bitcoin city, etc )
- Share some coffee and cold beverages with everyone. 
- short talk about a topic?

1. Be respectful.
2. No racism
3. No homophobia

Looking forward to your first **Crypto-vacation video call**.
